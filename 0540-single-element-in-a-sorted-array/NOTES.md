index:   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
vector: [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
👆 (Target element is 2 since it appears once)
In this example, before 2 every first instance of element occurs at even index and second instance at odd index (see element 1) and after 2 every first instance of element occurs at odd index and second instance at even index (see element 3, 4 and 8).
​
So from the above observation we will apply binary search on our array, and if we are on the PART - B side of array, we go to left, otherwise we go right.
​
// mid^1 explanation:
// If mid is odd then (mid^1) will always be the even number before mid
// If mid is even then (mid^1) will always be the odd number after mid
​
// And hence I am able to check whether mid is in left half or right half as:
​
// Suppose mid is odd: then mid^1 will give even number before it,
// then if nums[mid] == nums[mid^1]
// then 1st instance at even (mid^1) and 2nd instance at odd (mid),
// hence we are on left side otherwise we are on right side.
​
// Suppose mid is even: then mid^1 will give odd number after it,
// then if nums[mid] == nums[mid^1]
// then 1st instance at even (mid) and 2nd instance at odd (mid^1),
// hence we are on left side otherwise we are on right side
